# Shortest-Path-Finder
Task - Find the shortest path of a spanning tree

Program Overview:
Parses an input file entered by the user at run time to create a weighted graph.

Input file contains an order made to GraphMaker.cpp: 
    - Number of how many edges or verticies to add.
    - vertex name to add
    - vextex names to add weighted edge to
    - Print the Graph: show contained verticies and their edge information
    - Print Min spanning tree: Each step of the tree as the min heap sorts.

Creates a minimum spanning tree with the data represented in an adjacency list to determine the least costly path.

This program utilizes Dijkstra's algorithm to traverse a weighted graph using the least costly path.


Procedure and final output is logged during runtime in Graph.txt

Improvements I would like to add:

    - Improved visualization of MST as it maps.
    - More detailed explanation of Graph details
    - Visuals of graph
