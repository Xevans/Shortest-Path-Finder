Goal: 

- We want to input a an undirected graph with weighted edges. Then, we will use that to 	compute a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST).

- As changes occur to the graph, those changes will be reflected in the MST representation

	- Said changes will include: insertion and deletion of edges, verticies and changing 		weight values


Inputs:

- will come from standard input files specified by user.

-input format: 
	- begins with an initial number of verticies that the graph will start with.
	- Followed by a list of verticy names (one per line; in order).

Ex of initial file input (to init graph):
3
V1
V2
V3

- How edges are specified in input 

	- The number of edges will appear on one line, followed by a list of edges
	
Ex of edges betweeen vertecies being created
2
V1 V2 43
V2 V3 170

- We see that there will be two edges
- V1 links to V2 with a weight of 43
- V2 links to V3 with a weight of 170


Outputs:

- Will output to screen and output file (specified by user).
- For part 1, program will only need to print the MST for the initial g
