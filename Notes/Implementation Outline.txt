Implementation requirements:
- Must utilize 3 data structures
	- An undirected graph using an adjacency matrix (2D array OR link adjacency list)
	- MST will be stored in a multi-way tree with the left child -- right sibling representation
	- A binary heap (Prims algorithm)

- In laymans terms, you will need:
	- A matrix (for graph)
	- left child right sibling tree (for MST)
		- If graph becomes disconnected, you will have multiple MSTs
	-min heap

Steps

init a 2d array 

we will hard code test values for now.

we expect a 3 to be input that specifies that the matrix/2D array will look like 3x3 but in reality will be nxn

0 0 0      [0][0] [0][1] [0][2]
0 0 0 aka  [1][0] [1][1] [1][2]
0 0 0      [2][0] [2][1] [2][2]

using the value 3
we init a 2D array with [3][3]

This is the matrix representation of a 3x3 graph before weighted edges are made:

0 0 0
0 0 0 
0 0 0

	1	2	3
1     0     1     0

2     1     0     1

3     0     1     0


graph looks like:

1 -- 2 -- 3
